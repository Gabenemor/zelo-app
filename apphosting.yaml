# For sensitive values, it's recommended to use secret management

# or set them directly in the Firebase console if the feature is available.
# For non-sensitive values, you can define them directly.
environmentVariables:
  API_KEY: 'your_api_key_here' # Example, replace or remove if not used

  NODE_ENV: 'production' # Example of a common non-secret variable
  # This configuration is typically found in your Firebase project settings (Project settings > General > Your apps > Web app > SDK setup and configuration)
